## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

APJ 25 contains ADCs for the Mk.5 and Mk.6.

### Sabre Mk.1

One built as an exercise.

### Sabre Mk.2

Essentially an F-86E-1 (Goebel, Wikipedia). Added in [e60bc05](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/e60bc050da386cfabef4e2e7fca2a728ea8edd74).

### Sabre Mk.3

One built as an test-bed for the Orenda engine.

### Sabre Mk.4

Essentially an F-86E-10 (Goebel, Wikipedia). Some refitted with the 6-3 wing from 1954 in RAF service (Curtis. p. 154) or before being transferred to other users. Known as the “Sabre F.4” in RAF service.

To create the “Sabre Mk.4 (6-3 Wing)”, we can compare the F-86F (original wing) and F-86F-25 (unslatted 6-3 wing):
- Use turn drag from the F-25
- Use the speeds from the F-25
- No longer HTD
The comparison is not quite straightforward since the F-10 has a slightly more powerful engine than the E-10, but the ADC speeds for the E are identical to those of the F-10.

## Sabre Mk.5

ADC in APJ 25.

Unslatted 6-3 wing and Orenda 10 engine (Goebel, Curtis).

Adopt the minimum speeds from the F-25, but not the maximum speeds as they are greater due to the more powerful engine.

## Sabre Mk.6

ADC in APJ 25.

Unslatted 6-3 wing and Orenda 14 engine (Goebel).

Later production featured the slatted 6-3 wing from the F-40 (Goebel, Curtis). For the slatted wing, adopt the turn drag and minimum speeds from the F-40.
