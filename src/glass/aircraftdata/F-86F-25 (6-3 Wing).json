    "description": "The North American F-86F-25 Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, fighter-bomber. The F-86F-25 is derived from the F-86F-15/20, but has a second pair of weapon stations on the inner wing, allowing the aircraft to carry bombs or rockets in addition to a pair of 200 gal fuel tanks and giving it for the first time a useful range when used as a fighter-bomber. The F-86F-30 is similar.  This variant is a late-production or modified aircraft with the unslatted 6-3 wing, which gives better maneuverability at altitude but raises the landing and stall speed.",
