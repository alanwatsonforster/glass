## Notes and Changes

### Original ADC

APJ 50 contains an ADC for the Il-10.

### AtG Rating

I have added * to the AtG rating.

### Late Version

Later versions had four 23 mm NS-23 cannons in the wings with 150 rounds each and a read 20 mm B-20T cannon (with 150 rounds (Wikipedia).

The NS-23 has a rate of fire of 550 RPM (Wikipedia), so 150 rounds corresponds to 8 units of ammunition.

The B-20 has a rate of fire of 800 RPM (Wikipedia), so 150 rounds corresponds to 6 units of ammunition.

The Tu-16 has two NR-23 (650 RPM compared to 550 RPM) with 
- Hit roll: 3/2/1
- Damage rating: 4/3
- The rules on multiple guns are basically leave the to-hit numbers the same but increase the damage by 1 for each additional gun. That would suggest a hit number of 3/2/1 and damage of 6/5.
- The hit numbers are probably down because of the lack of maneuverability of the Tu-16. 

The MiG-15PF with 3 x NR-23 mm (650 RPM) with
- Hit roll: 5/3/2
- Damage rating: 5/5
- Damage rating should ne 5/5*
- Rate of fire of 3 x NR-23 is equivalent to 3.5 x NS-23.

We adopt:
- Hit Rill: 5/3/2
- Damage Rating: 5/5*

For the rear gun, we adopt the ratings for 2 x NR-23 cannon for the Il-28 with a -1 to the damage rating:
- Hit Roll: 3/2/1
- Damage Rating: 3.
