    "description": "The North American F-86F Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, day fighter. The F-86F described here corresponds to the F-86F-1/5/10/15/20 blocks. It is derived from the F-86E, and gains a more powerful engine and a better combat range as (with the exception of the very few F-1s) they can carry the larger 200 gal fuel tank in combat. This variant is the original with the early slatted wing.",
