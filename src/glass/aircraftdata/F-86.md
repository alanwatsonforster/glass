# F-86 Sabre

## Versions and Variants

### F-86A

- [ADC](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86A.json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

### F-86D

- [ADC](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86D.json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

### F-86E

- [ADC](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86E.json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

The E has an all-flying tail and radar ranging.

### F-86F

- [ADC for F-10](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86F-10.json)
- [ADC for F-25](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86F-25.json)
- [ADC for F-35](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86F-35.json)
- [ADC for F-40](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86F-40.json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

F-15 has the original wing and improved engine (APJ 25). F-25 has the unslatted 6-3 wing (APJ 25). F-35 is an F-25 with a nuclear capability (APJ 25). F-40 is an F-25 with the slatted 6-3 wing.

Goebel and Curtis (p. 72) says the F-5 could carry 200 gal FTs (each 1400 lb) on its wing stations. These are only rated for 1000 lb in the ADC from APJ 25. The station loads need increasing to 1400 each and the total load to 4800.

The lock-on number increases from 6 to 7 in the F-40. Why?

The F-86F-35 could carried a Mk 12 nuclear bomb on its port wing and drop tanks on its starboard wing (Goebel, Air Force). I assumed the Mk 12 has a weight of 1200 and 3.0 load points.

F-40 had the 6-3 wing with automatic slats and 12-inch wing-tip extensions (Curtis, p. 83)

### F-86H

- [ADC for early variant](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86H%20(Early).json)
- [ADC for late variant](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86H%20(Late).json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

### F-86K

- [ADC for early variant](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86K%20(Early).json)
- [ADC for late variant](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/blob/main/apxo/aircraftdata/F-86K%20(Late).json)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

### F-86L

- Has slatted 6.3 wing (Curtis, p. 56)

## Notes and Changes

### Radar Ranging

Baughter and Curtis (p. 62) states the APG-30 was standard in the E. Curtis (pp. 22-23) states that it was also installed on the last 25 As. Added in [ce5b473](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/ce5b473f08b4a4c616437a8f971983efbad2f73e).

### Fuel Tanks

- F-86A could use 120 gal (450L) FTs (Curtis, p. 36)
- F-86A could use 206 gal (772L) FTs for ferry missions (Curtis, p. 18-19)
- F-86D could use two 120 gal FTs (Curtis, p. 41)
- F-86D-25 first model with "jettisonable drop tanks" (Curtis, p. 49). I presume this means earlier models could use external FTs but not jettison them. The "definitive" version was the D-45 (Curtis, p. 50).
- F-86F-5 was the first Sabre to be able to use the 200 gal (760L and 1380 lb) FT (Curtis, p. 71).
- New pylon on the F-86F was inboard of the existing pylon for 120 gal FT or 1000 lb BB (Curtis, p. 72).
- F-86F-35 would carry Mk 12 20 kt nuclear bomb on inner left pylon and a FT on the other side (Curtis, p. 82).
- F-86H could also carry 1200 lb Mk 12 nuclear bomb (Curtis, p. 93)
- F-86L can carry only 120 gal FTs (SAC from 1958)

### Weapon Loads

- F-86A could carry up to 1000 lb of bombs on each of its two pylons (Curtis, p. 23).
- F-86A could carry 16 HVARs (Curtis, p. 23). They are carried in place of other stores (F-86A Flight Manual, p. 105)
- F-86D could be fitted with two inboard Sidewinder rails (Curtis., p. 155).
- F-86H could carry two 200 gal FTs and eight HVARs (SAC from 1956)
- F-86F could carry sixteen HVARs replacing other stores. On the F-86F-25 and later, eight may be carried in place of inner stores if the outer FTs are used (F-86F Flight Manual, p. 4-38).
- F-86F-25 and later cannot carry bombs on outer pylons (F-86F Flight Manual, p. 4-32).
- F-86H and later cannot carry anything but FTs on outer pylons (F-86H Flight Manual, p. 4-25).
- F-86H may carry 8 HVARs on inner wing (F-86H Flight Manual, p. 4-32).

I implement this are follows:

- A to E and F-1: Two 1400 lb stations. May use 120 gal (450L) FTs for combat; 200 gal FTs are for ferry only.
- F-5 to F-20: Two 1400 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs.
- F-25 and F-30: Two outer 1400 lb stations and two inner 1000 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs.
- F-35: Two outer 1400 lb stations and two inner 1200 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs. May use one Mk 12 nuclear bomb on station 3.
- F-40: As F-25
- H: As F-35.

- D/L/K: Two 1000 lb stations. May use 120 gal FTs. Two 200 lb inner-wing stations for IRMs. From 1958, may use AIM-9B IRMs.
