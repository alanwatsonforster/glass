### F-86A

ADC originally from APJ 25.

554 E produced by NA (Curtis, p. 36)

Has original wing.

J47-GE-7 engine with 5340 lb thrust (Curtis, p. 36).

Curtis (pp. 22-23) states that radar ranging was also installed on the last 25 As. I've not added this variant.

Entered service in March 1949 (Curtis, p. 19). First saw combat in Korea in December 1950.

### F-86D

ADC originally from APJ 25.

### F-86E

ADC originally from APJ 25.

226 E produced by NA (Curtis, p. 69)

Has original wing.

J47-GE-13 engine with 5450 lb thrust (Curtis, p. 62)

The E has an all-flying tail (Curtis, p. 61).

The APJ 25 ADC adds radar-ranging in the F. However, Baughter and Curtis (p. 62) states the APG-30 was standard in the E. Added.

Entered service in February 1951 and arrived in Korea in July 1951 (Curtis, p. 63).

### F-86F-1

J47-GE-27 with 5970 lb thrust (Curtis, p. 69).

78 produced (Curtis, p. 91)

F-1 entered service in April 1952 (Curtis p. 69). Arrived in Korea in June 1952 (Curtis., p. 70 and 73)

### F-86F-5

16 produced (Curtis, p. 91)

Goebel and Curtis (p. 72) says the F-5 could carry 200 gal FTs (each 1400 lb) on its wing stations. These are only rated for 1000 lb in the ADC from APJ 25. The station loads need increasing to 1400 each and the total load to 4800.

### F-86F

34  F-10 produced (Curtis, p. 91)
 7  F-15 produced (Curtis, p. 91)
100 F-20 produced (Curtis, p. 91)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

F-10 has the original wing and improved engine (APJ 25). 

The F-5/F-10/F-15/F-20 are similar (Curtis, p. 71)

Many early aircraft converted to 6-3 wing starting in September 1952 (Curtis p. 73). Since the F-25/30 was not produced until October 1952, these must have been F-20s and earlier.

### F-86F-25 (6-3 Wing)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

600 F-25 produced (Curtis, p. 91)

F-25 has the unslatted 6-3 wing (APJ 25). 

F-30 was identical, but built at Inglewood rather than Columbus (Curtis, p. 72)

Early F-25 had original wing. Later production had 6-3 wing (Curtis p. 73). Many early aircraft converted to 6-3 wing starting in September 1952 (Curtis p. 73).

First deliveries (to Korea) in October 1952.

### F-86F-35 (6-3 Wing)

ADC originally from APJ 25. F-35 is an F-25 with a nuclear capability (APJ 25). 

265 F-25 produced (Curtis, p. 91)

Early F-25 had original wing. Later production had 6-3 wing (Curtis p. 73). Many early aircraft converted to 6-3 wing starting in September 1952 (Curtis p. 73).

F-35 has the unslatted 6-3 wing (APJ 25). 

The F-86F-35 could carry a Mk 12 nuclear bomb on its port wing and drop tanks on its starboard wing (Goebel, Air Force). I assumed the Mk 12 has a weight of 1200 and 3.0 load points.

### F-86F-40

ADC originally from APJ 25.

280 F-40 produced by NA (Curtis, p. 91)
300 F-40 produced by Mitsubushi (Curtis, p. 91)

F-40 is essentially an F-25 with the slatted and extended 6-3 wing.

The lock-on number increases from 6 to 7 in the F-40. Why?

F-40 had the 6-3 wing with automatic slats and 12-inch wing-tip extensions (Curtis, p. 83). Deliveries started in 1955 (Curtis, p. 83). Many earlier F models brought up to F-40 standard before being supplied to other countries through MAP (Curtis., p. 83).

### F-86H

ADC originally from APJ 25.

This variant has the 6-3 wing.

Used GE J73, which was heavier but more powerful (8900 lb) (Curtis, p. 92).

Entered service in 1954 (Curtis, p. 94).

### F-86H (Extended 6-3 Wing)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

This variant has the extended 6-3 wing.

Production versions produced in 1955 and many earlier H models also converted (Curtis, p. 95).

### F-86K

ADC originally from APJ 25.

Like F-86D (Curtis, p. 103-104), so presumably original wing.

Delivered to Italian AF in 1955 (Curtis, p. 105). Deliveries to Italy, Netherlands, and Germany completed in 1958.

### F-86K (Extened 6-3)

ADC originally from APJ 25.

Last 45 has extended 6-3 wing (Curtis, p. 105).

### F-86L

ADC originally from APJ 25.

Has slatted 6.3 wing (Curtis, p. 56)

### Radar Ranging


### Fuel Tanks

- F-86A could use 120 gal (450L) FTs (Curtis, p. 36)
- F-86A could use 206 gal (772L) FTs for ferry missions (Curtis, p. 18-19). These tanks could be dropped, but limited the aircraft to 3G (F-96A Flight Manual, p. 126).
- F-86D could use two 120 gal FTs (Curtis, p. 41)
- F-86D-25 first model with "jettisonable drop tanks" (Curtis, p. 49). I presume this means earlier models could use external FTs but not jettison them. The "definitive" version was the D-45 (Curtis, p. 50).
- F-86F-5 was the first Sabre to be able to use the 200 gal (760L and 1380 lb) FT (Curtis, p. 71).
- New pylon on the F-86F was inboard of the existing pylon for 120 gal FT or 1000 lb BB (Curtis, p. 72).
- F-86F-35 would carry Mk 12 20 kt nuclear bomb on inner left pylon and a FT on the other side (Curtis, p. 82).
- F-86H could also carry 1200 lb Mk 12 nuclear bomb (Curtis, p. 93)
- F-86L can carry only 120 gal FTs (SAC from 1958)

### Weapon Loads

- F-86A could carry up to 1000 lb of bombs on each of its two pylons (Curtis, p. 23).
- F-86A could carry 16 HVARs (Curtis, p. 23). They are carried in place of other stores (F-86A Flight Manual, p. 105)
- F-86D could be fitted with two inboard Sidewinder rails (Curtis., p. 155).
- F-86H could carry two 200 gal FTs and eight HVARs (SAC from 1956)
- F-86F could carry sixteen HVARs replacing other stores. On the F-86F-25 and later, eight may be carried in place of inner stores if the outer FTs are used (F-86F Flight Manual, p. 4-38).
- F-86F-25 and later cannot carry bombs on outer pylons (F-86F Flight Manual, p. 4-32).
- F-86H and later cannot carry anything but FTs on outer pylons (F-86H Flight Manual, p. 4-25).
- F-86H may carry 8 HVARs on inner wing (F-86H Flight Manual, p. 4-32).

I implement this are follows:

- A to E and F-1: Two 1400 lb stations. May use 120 gal (450L) FTs for combat; 200 gal FTs are for ferry only.
- F-5 to F-20: Two 1400 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs.
- F-25 and F-30: Two outer 1400 lb stations and two inner 1000 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs.
- F-35: Two outer 1400 lb stations and two inner 1200 lb stations. May use 120 or 200 gal FTs. May use one Mk 12 nuclear bomb on station 3.
- F-40: As F-25
- H: As F-35.

- D/L/K: Two 1000 lb stations. May use 120 gal FTs. Two 200 lb inner-wing stations for IRMs. From 1958, may use AIM-9B IRMs.

### Wings

#### Original wing

#### 6-3 wing

In APJ 25, JDW writes about the 6-3 wing on the F-25:

> On the data card, this is reflected by reducing the minimum allowed speed at higher altitudes rather than reducing the decel for turning, since the next-lowest gameable decel amount is 0.5, which would skew the data card's power-to-decel relationship too far from reality compared to the other cards. One last thing about the 6-3 wing is that the Sabre's low-speed handling characteristics were degraded, but this applied to the landing regime and is not reflected in game terms. Adequately trained pilots had no problems with it.

#### Extended 6-3 wing
