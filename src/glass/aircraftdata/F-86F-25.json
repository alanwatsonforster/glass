    "description": "The North American F-86F-25 Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, fighter-bomber. The F-86F-25 version is derived from the F-86F-15/-20 versions, but has the unslatted 6-3 wing, which gives improved performance at altitude at a cost of higher landing and stall speed. It also has a second pair of weapon stations on the inner wing, allowing the aircraft to carry bombs or rockets in addition to a pair of 200 gal fuel tanks and giving it for the first time a useful range when used as a fighter-bomber.",
