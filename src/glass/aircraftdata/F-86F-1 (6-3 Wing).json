    "description": "The North American F-86F Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, day fighter. The F-86F-1 is derived from the F-86E, but gains a more powerful engine. This variant is modified with the unslatted 6-3 wing, which gives better maneuverability at altitude but raises the landing and stall speed.",
