## Notes and Changes

### Radar

The Tu-16 radar is "PRS-1AG Argo" and the tail radar is "Bee Hind" (Goebel).

### Guns

The guns are AM-23 (Wikipedia), not NR-23 (Goebel). An AM-23 has a rate of fire of 1250 RPM, whereas an NR-23s has a rate of fire of 825 RPM. So, two AM-23s are similar to three NR-23s. Equivalently, the six AM-23s on the Tu-16 have a similar rate of fire as the ten NR-23s on the Tu-4.

I have no information on the ammunition load. However, Goebels states that the similarly-armed Tu-95 has 2500 rounds total. This is about 416 rounds per gun or about 10 two-second bursts.

One AM-23 is mounted firing forwards (Goebel). I have adapted this from the IL-28, reducing the hit rolls from 3/2/1 to 2/1/1 to represent the difficulty of aiming with such a large aircraft and keeping the damage ratings as 4/3*.

### Nuclear Bombs

Carried the [RDS-37](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RDS-37#Delivery_method). [Weight 5570 kg](https://ia600506.us.archive.org/9/items/DnaEm1CapabilitiesOfNuclearWeapons/RDS-37%20_%20MilitaryRussia.Ru%20-%20domestic%20military%20equipment%20%28after%201945%29.pdf)

### Crew

The crew of the base Tu-16 is six (Goebels).

The bomb load was initially smaller (Goebels).

### Tu-16K

This actually represents several -K subversions.

## Operational History

Introduced in 1954.
