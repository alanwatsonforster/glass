## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

TSOH has ADCs for the AD-4, AD-6/A-1H, and AD-7/A-1J.

### AD-4

Four 20 mm M3 each with 200 rounds (Wikipedia). Guns changed from Mk 12 (from the original TSOH ADC) to M3 in [1e051cb](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/1e051cbb5e75da017d8c016e9726645657c6d3ff).

### AD-5/A-1E

ADC adapted by AWF from A-1H. Added in [f9d795f](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/f9d795ffd56c21ee5bb0e962e8952c32de47ff89).

This had side-by-side seating for a pilot and copilot. The 602nd Air Commando Squadron used the A-1E in Farm Gate with a USAF pilot and Vietnamese copilot, but in later USAF and USN action it flew with only a pilot (see the shoot-downs of Sather and Goss and the rescue by Fisher).

The A-1E omits the lateral dive brakes and retains only the ventral dive brakes, so its speed brake DP capability is less than that of the other A-1s. Added in [c7fc1dc](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/c7fc1dca91757dd5eec766faee8ae8cef6d66429).

Wikipedia mentions it being flown by the USN, USMC, USAF, and RVNAF.

Four 20 mm M3 each with 200 rounds (SAC). Guns changed from Mk 12 (from the original TSOH ADC) to M3 in [1e051cb](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/1e051cbb5e75da017d8c016e9726645657c6d3ff).

### AD-6/A-1H

Four 20 mm M3 each with 200 rounds (SAC). Guns changed from Mk 12 (from the original TSOH ADC) to M3 in [1e051cb](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/1e051cbb5e75da017d8c016e9726645657c6d3ff).

### AD-7/A-1J

Four 20 mm M3 each with 200 rounds (SAC). Guns changed from Mk 12 (from the original TSOH ADC) to M3 in [1e051cb](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/1e051cbb5e75da017d8c016e9726645657c6d3ff).

### Stanley Yankee Extraction System

[Jayne](https://www.airuniversity.af.edu/Portals/10/ASPJ/journals/Volume-31_Issue-2/V-Jayne.pdf) states that the Stanley extraction system was retrofitted in 1967. Added to ADCs in [3d3f674](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/3d3f674dcca86a640f4df7996111a4826d654c24).
