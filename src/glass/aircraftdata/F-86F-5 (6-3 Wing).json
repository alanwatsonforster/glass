    "description": "The North American F-86F Sabre is a single-engined, swept-wing, day fighter. The F-86F-5 is derived from the F-86E, and gains a more powerful engine and a better combat range as they can carry the larger 200 gal fuel tank in combat. This “F-86F-10 (6-3 Wing)” variant is modified with the unslatted 6-3 wing, which gives better maneuverability at altitude but raises the landing and stall speed.",
