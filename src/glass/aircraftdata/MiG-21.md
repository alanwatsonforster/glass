## Notes and Changes

### Summary of TSOH and Revised Version

The TSOH ADCs from 1994 give versions which do not seem to correspond precisely to our current (much better) knowledge of MiG-21 version. I have attempted to determine which current version corresponds to which TSOH version:

- TSOH F = F-13 (able to use AA-2 IRMs)
- TSOH PF = PF
- TSOH FL = FL
- TSOH Improved PF = PFM
- TSOH PFMA = S
- TSOH export FPMA = M
- TSOH MF = SM
- TSOH export MF = MF

### MiG-21F

ADC adapted by AWF from that of the F-13.

### MiG-21F-13

ADC from the TSOH. The TSOH ADC describes an "MiG-21F" with only one gun, primitive radar, and the ability to carry AA-2 IRMs; this seems to be a MiG-21F-13.

### MiG-21PF

ADC from TSOH.

### MiG-21PFM

ADC from TSOH. In TSOH it is described as an "improved PFM".

### MiG-21FL

ADC from TSOH.

### MiG-21S

ADC from TSOH. The TSOH ADC for the MiG-21MF describes an "MiG-21PFMA" that is an early version of the "MiG-21MF" but with less AB power that the MF, a RP-22 (Jaybird) radar, no gun but the ability to carry a GP-9 gunpack, and the ability to use AA-2 IRMs and RHMs; since the "MiG-21MF" seems to be a MiG-21SM, this "MiG-21PFMA" seems to be a MiG-21S.

### MiG-21M

ADC from TSOH. The TSOH ADC describes an "MiG-21PFMA export version" as a "MiG-21PFMA" with a Spin Scan-B radar and internal GSh-21 gun; since the "MiG-21PFMA" seems to be an MiG-21S, this "MiG-21PFMA export version" seems to be a MiG-21M.

### MiG-21SM

ADC from the TSOH. The TSOH ADC labels this as an MF.

### MiG-21MF

ADC from TSOH. The TSOH ADC describes an "MiG-21MF export version" with Spin Scan-B radar, but this appears to be simply a MiG-21MF. It is further adapted based on information in the Wikipedia article on MiG-21 variants, which is based on Gordon.

### MiG-21bis

### Radars

I have taken the radar names from the Wikipedia article on MiG-21 versions, which is derived from Gordon. Added in [750fd28](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/750fd2867100ac5945edb520e325bed56558157e) and [baa63c7](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/baa63c78114b2940d2e13d44342c74bba76f8f48).

### NR-30 Guns

See [#208](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/issues/208).

### Missiles

The Wikipedia article on variants states that the MF could not use AA-2C RHMs, but could use AA-8 IRMs as a new capability. Added in [999ee10](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/999ee109bb9c96551b483289f47ac8e0d9959a4b).

### Use of GP-9

Müller states that the GP-9 was only used on the PFM, FL, and S. Removed from PF in [4e62484](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/commit/4e624841cf6d4b5e1c6cfd8189370378c6a86d6f).
