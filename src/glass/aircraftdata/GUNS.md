## Notes

### Multiple Guns

Rule 9.1 states that the AtA damage ratings are increased by 1 for each additional gun. 

In contrast, the ADCs suggest that the AtG damage rating increases linearly with the number of guns. For example, if it is 4 for two guns, then it should be 6 for three guns.

### Air-to-Ground Modifiers

- Less than 20 mm = ** (no effect)
- Less than 20 mm = * (halved)
  - Also 30 mm Mk108 on Me-262 in APJ 32
- More than 20 mm but less than 30 mm = no effect
  - But 25 mm GAU-22/A is _ in Puma's files (special AP shell?)
- 30 mm or more = underlined (-1 modifier)
  - Not ADEN or DEFA, as they use the smaller 30×113 mm cartidge whereas other guns use 30×150 mm or larger.
  - Otherwise, omissions of _ seem to be an error

### Hit Rolls

For fighters, the range 0 roll seems to be 7 for 6000 RPM, 6 for 2000-5000 RPM, 5 for and 4 for less than 2000 RPM.

These do not just depend on the gun. For the same gun, a less maneuverable aircraft has a lower hit roll; compare the F-51 and B-26, the F-100 and B-57, and the A1 and F4-U.

The rolls for the A-7 and F-111 are apparently lower because the gun is inclined for strafing. The F-111 also probably suffers for lack of maneuverability.

### .50 cal M2

After WW2, the .50 cal M2 gun gave way to the .50 cal M3 gun. The rates of fire are 800 RPM for the M2 and 1200 RPM for the M3. Thus, effectively three M2s is equivalent to two M3s. This does not seem to be taken into account in the original ratings for the F-51 or B-26.

The AtA ratings can be found by matching total RPM. The AtG ratings seem to be 2/3 for each M3, which would translate to 01/2 for each M2.

RPM = rounds per minute

FPS = muzzle velocity in feet per second


## British Guns

### 20 mm Hispano Mk. 1 to Mk. V

British licensed versions of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404. Single-barreled gas-operation with a rate of 700 RPM and muzzle velocity of 870 m/s.

Meteor and Sea Hawk (four): Hit rolls of 6/4/3 and damage ratings of 5/6*.

#### Aircraft

- [Meteor](Meteor.md) (Four Mk V)
- [Sea Fury](Sea%20Fury.md) (Four Mk V)

### 30 mm Aden

First version had 1300 RPM. Mk. 4 had 1200-1500 RPM. Mk. 5 had 1500-1700 RPM (Wikipedia).

Muzzle velocity of 2610 ft/s (Wikipedia).

CAC Sabre (two): Hit rolls of 6/4/2 and damage ratings of 6/6.

#### Aircraft

- [CAC Sabre](Avon%20Sabre.md) (two)

#### Bibliography

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADEN_cannon)

## US Guns

### 0.50 cal M2

800 RPM and 2910 ft/s (Wikipedia).

Scaling by RPM, one M2 is equivalent to two-thirds of an M3, so 6 = 4, 8 = 5, and 14 = 9.

- F-51 and F4U-4 (six): Original hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 4/4**.
- B-26B (fourteen): Original hit rolls of 4/2/1 and damage ratings of 7/9**.
- B-26K (eight): Original hit rolls of 4/2/1 and damage ratings of 5/6**.

The hit rolls of the B-28B are lower, probably to account for its lack of maneuverability.

These damage ratings seem to be more appropriate for M3 guns. Also, it seems odd for the B-26 to have a hit roll of 1 at 2 hexes, but the F-80 has a hit roll of 0. I would suggest:

- F-51 and F4U-1 (six): hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 3/3** (equal to F-94B with four M3)
- B-26C (six): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 3/3** (equal to F-94B with four M3)
- B-26K (eight): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 4/4** (equal to F-80C with six M3)
- B-26B (fourteen): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 5/6** (equal to CF-100 Mk4 with eight M3)

These suggestions were applied in 
[e615570](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/e61557086cfc61119e920453d1bded66bac57bd3).

- [B-29](B-29.md) (six, eight, or fourteen fixed and up to two turrets each with two)
- [F-51](F-51.md) (six)

### 0.50 cal M3

Faster-firing electrically feed-boosted version of the M2. Rate of fire is 1200 RPM (Wikipedia). Muzzle velocity assumed to be the same.

- T-33A (two): hit rolls of 4/2/- and damage ratings of 1/2**.
- F-94B (four): hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 3/3**.
- Canadair Sabre and F-80C (six): Hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 4/4**.
- CF-100 Mk 4 (eight): Hit rolls of 6/4/1 and damage ratings of 5/6**.

### 20 mm M2/M3

US adaptions of British version of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404. The M1 was adapted from the Mk 1 but did not see service (Chin, p. 25), the M2 developed from the M1, and the M3 adapted from the Mk V. Compared to the British versions, the US versions are noted as being susceptible to misfires which required re-cocking on the ground (except those in the P-38 which could be re-cocked in flight).

Do not confuse the 20 mm M2 cannon with the 0.50 cal M2 machine gun.

Rate of fire 620 RPM for M2 and 720 RPM for M3.

Assume the same muzzle velocity as other Hispano-Suiza derivatives of about 2850 ft/s.

- F4U-4B (four): hit rolls of 6/3/2 and damage ratings of 5/6*.
- AD-4/5/6/7 (four): hit rolls of 5/4/3 and damage ratings of 5/6*.

#### Aircraft

M2 used by: 

- [B-29](B-29.md) (one in tail)

M3 used by: 

- [AU-1](F4U:AU.md) (four)

### 20 mm Mk 16

The SAC for the F2H-3/4 states that it is armed with four "20mm (Mk.16)" guns. Chin (p. 27) states that the "Mk 16 Mod 0" is a "M3 gun modified by NGF to use Mk 8 feed". I presume the NGF is the [Naval Gun Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard#1900s).

Do not confuse this with the "Mark 16," which was M3/M24 cannon adapted for small-craft in Vietnam.

Used by: [F2H-3/4](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/wiki/ADCs-—-F2H-Banshee).

### 20 mm Colt Mk 12

Developed from the M24, using a lighter round for a higher rate of fire (1000 RPM) and muzzle velocity (1010 m/s).

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Mk_12_cannon)

### 20 mm M39 (T-160)
