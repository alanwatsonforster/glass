\section*{Ilyushin Il-28}

The Ilyushin Il-28 is a conventional and nuclear tactical bomber and a long-range reconnaissance aircraft. The NATO reporting name is “Beagle”.

It is powered by two Klimov VK-1 engines in underwing pods. This engine is a development on the Klimov RD-45 unauthorized copy of the Rolls-Royce Nene engine, and was also used in the MiG-15bis.

The Il-28 is a conventional tactical bomber. It is armed with two fixed 23 mm NR-23 cannons and two more in a defensive tail mount. It can carry up to 3,000 kg (6,600 lb) of bombs in its internal bomb bay, but a normal load is 1,000 kg (2,200 lb).

The Il-28R is a long-range photo-reconnaissance aircraft. Its bomb bay is given over to cameras, flares, and additional fuel. It also is equipped with two 350L wing-tip fuel tanks. One of the forward-firing guns is replaced by reconnaissance equipment.

The Il-28N is a nuclear tactical bomber. It can carry the RDS-4 nuclear bomb in its internal bomb bay. Like the Il-28R, it is equipped with two 350L wing-tip fuel tanks.
