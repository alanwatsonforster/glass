## ADCs

- [F-51D](F-51D.json)
- [RF-51D](RF-51D.json)

## Notes and Changes

### Original ADCs

APJ 32 contains ADCs for the F-51D and RF-51D.

### Guns

Six .50 cal M2 guns with 1840 rounds total (Wikipedia). Specified as M2 guns in [8cee6b0](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/8cee6b01a1744e54cf70e85c08d94d8a57d71be3).

Gun effectiveness reduced for lower rate of fire of the M2 in 
[e615570](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/e61557086cfc61119e920453d1bded66bac57bd3).

### RF-51D

The earlier P-51A has two K24 7-inch cameras (one oblique pointing left and one vertical), and I assume the F-6D did too (Wikipedia). Added in [6f6319a](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/glass/commit/6f6319ac58eb8098d0159d2f888180dc3ee0aaea).

### Loads

RAAF Mustangs used 500 lb bombs, 60 lb rockets, 260 lb fragmentation bombs, 455L napalm tanks, and “armor piercing high-velocity rockets" (Stephens, p. 225).

USAF Mustangs used 100 lb, 250 lb, or 500 lb bombs or a pair of 110 US gal (750 lb) napalm tanks on the inner wing stations (Thomson). USAF Mustangs also used the RAM/ATAR (Wikipedia on RAM)
