RPM = rounds per minute

FPS = muzzle velocity in feet per second

## British Guns

### 20 mm Hispano Mk. 1 to Mk. V

British licensed versions of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404. Single-barreled gas-operation with a rate of 700 RPM and muzzle velocity of 870 m/s.

Meteor and Sea Hawk (four): Hit rolls of 6/4/3 and damage ratings of 5/6*.

#### Aircraft

- [Meteor](Meteor.md) (Four Mk V)
- [Sea Fury](Sea%20Fury.md) (Four Mk V)

### 30 mm Aden

First version had 1300 RPM. Mk. 4 had 1200-1500 RPM. Mk. 5 had 1500-1700 RPM (Wikipedia).

Muzzle velocity of 2610 ft/s (Wikipedia).

Avon Sabre (two): Hit rolls of 6/4/2 and damage ratings of 6/6.

## US Guns

### 0.50 cal M2

800 RPM and 2910 ft/s (Wikipedia).

Scaling by RPM, one M2 is equivalent to two-thirds of an M3, so 6 = 4, 8 = 5, and 14 = 9.

- F-51 and F4U-4 (six): Original hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 4/4**.
- B-26B (fourteen): Original hit rolls of 4/2/1 and damage ratings of 7/9**.
- B-26K (eight): Original hit rolls of 4/2/1 and damage ratings of 5/6**.

The hit rolls of the B-28B are lower, probably to account for its lack of maneuverability.

These damage ratings seem to be more appropriate for M3 guns. Also, it seems odd for the B-26 to have a hit roll of 1 at 2 hexes, but the F-80 has a hit roll of 0. I would suggest:

- F-51 and F4U-1 (six): hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 3/3** (equal to F-94B with four M3)
- B-26C (six): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 3/3** (equal to F-94B with four M3)
- B-26K (eight): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 4/4** (equal to F-80C with six M3)
- B-26B (fourteen): hit rolls of 4/2/0 and damage ratings of 5/6** (equal to CF-100 Mk4 with eight M3)

### 0.50 cal M3

Faster-firing electrically feed-boosted version of the M2. Rate of fire is 1200 RPM (Wikipedia). Muzzle velocity assumed to be the same.

- T-33A (two): hit rolls of 4/2/- and damage ratings of 1/2**.
- F-94B (four): hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 3/3**.
- Canadair Sabre and F-80C (six): Hit rolls of 6/3/0 and damage ratings of 4/4**.
- CF-100 Mk 4 (eight): Hit rolls of 6/4/1 and damage ratings of 5/6**.

### 20 mm M2/M3

US adaptions of British version of the Hispano-Suiza HS.404. The M1 was adapted from the Mk 1 but did not see service (Chin, p. 25), the M2 developed from the M1, and the M3 adapted from the Mk V. Compared to the British versions, the US versions are noted as being susceptible to misfires which required re-cocking on the ground (except those in the P-38 which could be re-cocked in flight).

Do not confuse the 20 mm M2 cannon with the 0.50 cal M2 machine gun.

Rate of fire 620 RPM for M2 and 720 RPM for M3.

Assume the same muzzle velocity as other Hispano-Suiza derivatives of about 2850 ft/s.

- F4U-4B (four): hit rolls of 6/3/2 and damage ratings of 5/6*.
- AD-4/5/6/7 (four): hit rolls of 5/4/3 and damage ratings of 5/6*.

#### Aircraft

M2 used by: 

- [B-29](B-29.md) (one in tail)

M3 used by: 

- [AU-1](F4U:AU.md) (four)
- [F4U-5/5P/5N/5NL](F4U:AU.md) (four)
- [AD/A-1](AD:A-1.md) (four)

### 20 mm Mk 16

The SAC for the F2H-3/4 states that it is armed with four "20mm (Mk.16)" guns. Chin (p. 27) states that the "Mk 16 Mod 0" is a "M3 gun modified by NGF to use Mk 8 feed". I presume the NGF is the [Naval Gun Factory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington_Navy_Yard#1900s).

Do not confuse this with the "Mark 16," which was M3/M24 cannon adapted for small-craft in Vietnam.

Used by: [F2H-3/4](https://github.com/alanwatsonforster/apxo/wiki/ADCs-—-F2H-Banshee).

### 20 mm M24

M3 with electrical cocking to allow recovery from misfires.

M24 used by: B-36, B-47, B-66, F-89C.

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hispano-Suiza_HS.404#U.S._production)

### 20 mm Colt Mk 12

Developed from the M24, using a lighter round for a higher rate of fire (1000 RPM) and muzzle velocity (1010 m/s).

- [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colt_Mk_12_cannon)

### 20 mm M39 (T-160)
